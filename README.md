# Project Description
An exploration of the concept of Transfer Learning & Fine-Tuning hands-on. 
The task is about determining the categorical age of people based on their facial feature. This is done by fine-tuning a general purpose CV Neural Network (MobileNetV2) which is fine-tuned to gain expertise on face evaluation.
